Question 4. [10 marks]

a) Create a class called Triangle which has object variables for sides a, b and c. The Triangle
class should have a constructor and a string conversion method. It should also have a
method which returns the perimeter of the triangle.     [7]

a) 


class Triangle: #1

self.side_a = a
self.side_b = b    #1 for all assignments
self.side_c = c

def __str__(self):  #1
return str(self.side_a) + "," + str(self.side_b) + "," + str(self.side_c) #1

def perimeter(self): #1
